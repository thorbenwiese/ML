Aufgabe 7.2

a)

An eigenvector describes the direction of a squared matrix and a matrix can 
only have as many eigenvectors as dimensions. If one eigenvector covers most of 
the data variance then this means that the data is mostly spread in one 
dimension and that therefore one dimension is the most important one.

b)

If the eigenvector v = [0,1,1,1]^T covers 85% of the data variance, then this 
means for this example that the age of the participants does not have a 
significant impact on the data and can therefore be neglected.

Aufgabe 7.3

b)

The dataset contains of 1288 images.
Each image has 1850 pixels
The pixel values range from 0.33333334 to 255.0.

There are 5761 classes (persons). 
The distribution of these images is not balanced. For each person there are 
up to 530 images (George Bush), but for most of them only 1-20 images exists.

c)

150 components is a fair trade-off between calculation time and precision.
However, it could have been lower (e.g. between 50-75) with similar results 
and better performance.

d)

It depends on what 'acceptable' results are, but we would suggest picking a 
value between 50 and 75.

e)

The Eigenfaces algorithm could be used for automated passport control (ABC) 
systems. It will have a good accuracy if the images taken from the passengers 
have high quality and if the passenger's look hasn't changed a lot, e.g. is 
wearing glasses or a beard. However, there will always be a risk that people use 
passports of other people that look alike and trick the system in that way.
