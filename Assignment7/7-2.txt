Aufgabe 7.2

a)

An eigenvector describes the direction of a squared matrix and a matrix can 
only have as many eigenvectors as dimensions. If one eigenvector covers most of 
the data variance then this means that the data is mostly spread in one 
dimension and that therefore one dimension is the most important one.

b)

If the eigenvector v = [0,1,1,1]^T covers 85% of the data variance, then this 
means for this example that the age of the participants does not have a 
significant impact on the data and can therefore be neglected.
