Assignment 02.2
d)
Only to some extend. We can expect that the matrix gets more and more 
inaccurate, the bigger it gets. If we work with smaller matrices, we could 
probably ignore the error, but if the matrix has a large size, than we 
should improve our floating point calculation to avoid the inaccuracy.

e)
The check result should return only 0s, but since the matrix gets more
inaccurate the bigger it gets due to the floating point calculation
1/x the results are already (a little bit) wrong for k = 3. Therefore the 
matrix is 'special', because it gets more inaccurate, the bigger it gets.

c)
None of the plotted data has a 'clean' normal distribution. The data for 
latitude and longitude does not have a normal distribution, since 
the data is not symmetric around the mean value and the other histograms show 
that even if the data was symmetric around the mean value, the whole data would 
not be under the area of the curve. Therefore none of the histograms has a 
normal distribution.

e)
The test and training set distribution match. The results can be seen in the 
plotted histograms that compare both distributions.
