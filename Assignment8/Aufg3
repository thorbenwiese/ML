b.) Compare the classifier scores (e.g. accuracy, precision) with the above runs.
	In general the score decrease if you filter. At nearly every classifier this decrease amounts to 10-15% in average. An exception of this is kNN where the decrease amounts to more than 50% (0.86 -> 0.26).
c.) Look at the confusion matrices. Can you explain some of the mispredictions?
d.) Is any one classifier the clear winner for this task?
	No, there isn't a clear winner for the tasks. The Classifiers' scores are mostly quit similar. But there are some classifiers - for e.g. MultinomialNB - which have small training- and test time beside a good score. Some classifiers benefits from filtering in task b (large time requirements, e.g. SGD) more than other (small time requirements, e.g. BernoulliNB).
